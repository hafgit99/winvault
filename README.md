## 🛡️ Security Features

WinVault utilizes military-grade encryption and advanced protection mechanisms:

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture:** Your data never leaves your device unencrypted.
- **Argon2id & WASM Core:** State-of-the-art key derivation (Argon2id) running in isolated WebAssembly memory for maximum protection.
- **Security Auditing & Logging:** Comprehensive `securityLogger` tracks failed logins, integrity breaches, and suspicious activity in an encrypted audit trail.
- **Enhanced Rate Limiting:** Intelligent protection using exponential backoff and device fingerprinting to thwart brute-force attacks.
- **Platform Hardening:**
  - **Strict CSP:** Comprehensive Content Security Policy to prevent XSS.
  - **Memory Protection:** Active anti-debugging with panic mode and OS-level key encryption (SafeStorage).
  - **Secure Auto-Type:** Fileless credential injection using direct memory streams (stdin pipe) to reduce forensic footprint.
- **Hardware Integration:** 
  - **WebAuthn / FIDO2:** Support for YubiKey/Titan keys via cross-platform credentials.
  - **Biometrics:** Windows Hello and TouchID integration.
- **Data Integrity:** Database protected by HMAC-SHA256 signature verification.
